# Key roles and responsibilities of a Data Analyst
A data analyst sits between the business and the data.

What do we mean by that?

The Business refers to the client and your internal team members who won’t be involved in detailed data analysis.
They rely on your analysis to make strategic business decisions.
Importantly, not everyone will have a strong understanding of data. Your job is to communicate your data findings simply and clearly for everyone to understand.
 
The Data refers to the relevant data sources that you will clean, process, and use to generate interesting insights for the business.

As a Data Analyst at Accenture, you’ll get to work across a range of different clients and projects. This keeps things interesting, as there are always new problems to solve and new topics to learn about.

However, our clients often want accurate results in a tight timeframe. The pace of work is fast and you’ll need to get up to speed on new projects as quickly as possible.

Now you know a bit more about the role, let’s get back to the project with Social Buzz.

# Read the brief from Social Buzz

It includes the volume of information, the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope of the data points being covered (known as the "three v's" of big data).
