So, let’s have a look at what data you have to work with. The client has sent through:

7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

1. Requirements gathering
2. Data cleaning
3. Data modelling
