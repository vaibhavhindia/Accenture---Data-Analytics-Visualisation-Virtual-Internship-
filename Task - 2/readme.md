# Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling
Modeling Data to create Valuable Insight. 

# Skills 

# First up, requirements gathering
As we mentioned, you have been sent 7 datasets and a data model.

Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.

So, the first step is to use this data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

When you think you’ve identified the right data sets to include, complete the multi choice quiz to move onto the next step.


# Let's dive into the data
Now you have a good understanding of the project and your role - it’s time to get to work!

Don’t worry if you haven’t done data analysis before, we’ll take you through each step and provide support along the way.

So, let’s have a look at what data you have to work with. The client has sent through:

7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.
There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions you’ll follow these steps:

1. Requirements gathering
2. Data cleaning
3. Data modelling

1. UUID - Universally Unique Identifiers
2. Array - List with a number of elements in a specific order—typically of the same type
3. Integer - Numeric data type for numbers without fractions
4. Timestamp - Number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight (00:00:00 UTC), 1st January 1970 (Unix time)
